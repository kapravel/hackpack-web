HackPack CTF is a security competition that is part of the two security courses at NCSU: CSC-405 Computer Security and CSC-537 Systems Attacks and Defenses. The target audience is people interested in computer security that have some related background (like took a security course before ;) and want to exercise their skills in a secure environment by solving security challenges.

### Team Registration

You can register your team [here](https://ctf2025.hackpack.club)! (Registration will open on April 1st)

### Important dates

The CTF will start on **April 11th at 12pm EDT** and finish on April 12th at 12pm EDT (24 hours).

### CTF format

This competition is a Jeopardy-style CTF, which means that challenges are independent and run on our infrastructure. This year, we are not following the traditional categories (pwn,re,web,etc), but instead are introducing a new set of categories that would be revealed on the day of the competition.

The competition has dynamic scoring, so the more people solve a challenge the less amount of points everyone that solved it gets.

### Flag format

All flags in the competition have the following format: `flag{abc}`

### Challenge difficulty

The challenges in this competition are designed so that a significant subset of them can be solved within a 24-hour live event that is happening every year at NCSU as part of the security classes of the semester. 

### Rules

None of the challenges require bruteforcing, so any action causing unnecessarily high loads for CPU/GPU, traffic, memory, I/O, etc. on our infrastructure, other teams or any other party is strictly prohibited. 

If you discover a bug that is affecting the competition, let us know (#bug-reporting channel on discord) instead of acting maliciously (deleting flags, breaking the challenge deliberately, etc).

Lastly, do not share flags with other teams or ask for flags. Be a l33t hacker and capture the flags with your sk177z.

### Sponsors

HackPack CTF could not have been possible without our [sponsors]({% link sponsors25.md %}) .
