#### Original Description
<p>Apparently Dr. Evil's minions knew that our agency was making copies of their source code,
because they intentionally sabotaged this source code in order to make it harder for our agents
to analyze and crack into! The result is a quite mess, but I trust that my best special agent
will find a way to solve it.</p>
